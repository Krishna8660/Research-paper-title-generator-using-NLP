# Research-paper-title-generator-using-NLP
📑 Research Paper Title Generator
🔹 Overview

This project automates research paper title generation using advanced NLP techniques. It leverages GPT-2 with LoRA fine-tuning to generate concise, meaningful titles from scientific abstracts, reducing manual effort for researchers.

🔹 Key Features

⚡ Title Generation: Generates short, context-aware paper titles from abstracts.

🔍 Semantic Evaluation: Uses SBERT (Sentence-BERT) to measure similarity between generated and original titles.

🌐 Web Application: Built with Gradio for real-time abstract input and title generation.

📊 Batch Processing: Supports multiple abstracts at once with similarity score visualization.

🔹 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Frameworks/Libraries:

Hugging Face Transformers (GPT-2, LoRA fine-tuning)

SBERT (Sentence-BERT)

Gradio (UI)

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib (data handling & visualization)

Modeling: Fine-tuned GPT-2 with LoRA adapters

Deployment: Gradio Web App

🔹 Project Workflow

Preprocess scientific abstracts.

Generate concise titles using GPT-2 + LoRA fine-tuning.

Evaluate semantic similarity using SBERT embeddings.

Display results in a user-friendly Gradio interface.

🔹 Results

Generated titles closely matched original paper titles.

Improved semantic relevance measured via SBERT similarity scores.

Demonstrated efficiency in reducing researchers’ time in title drafting.

🔹 Future Improvements

Integration with LangChain for prompt optimization.

Support for multi-lingual abstracts.

Deployment as a FastAPI service for scalability.
